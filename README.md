NuteNet project explores different machine learning approaches to model maize leaf nutrient (N, P, K, etc) % and leaf gas exchange traits.

Directories:
- Data - contains tensors for CNN and tabular data for other ML.
- Jupyter Notebooks
	- LeafScans1 - Merge and explore raw data
	- LeafScans2 - Code training-testing loop for 5-fold cross-validation and apply with simple linear regression.
	- LeafScans3 - Use Partial Least Squares, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine regressions to predict targets.
	- LeafScans4 - Code a convolutional nerual net to predict leaf N % from NDVI image of leaf.
