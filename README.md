NuteNet project explores different methodologies to Nutrient prediction from hyperspectral images (HSI). 

- DataTensors directory contains Test and train splits of processed HSI cubes 364 channels into 1 channel CorNDVI images for use by NuteNet CNN.
- Scripts directory. Three scripts divided by methodology scope. Linear regression, 1-D ML approaches (PLSR-RF-NN), 2-D ML approaches (CNN)
- ScansNutesAll.csv file contains various nutrient values and HSI data processed into average values by channel for use by Linear regression and 1-D ML.
